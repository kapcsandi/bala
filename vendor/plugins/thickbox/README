ThickBoxObject v.1.0
====================
This will add a helper for thickboxes in Rails. (It is a fork of Lipsiasoft/lightbox) It is a work in progress, though. So please be patience.

<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

You must also add this stylesheet to your view (in the header):

<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'thickbox' %>

It is very simple to add a ThickBox in your page:

<%= thickbox_link_to "Link Name", "/path/of/your/image.png" %> 
or
<%= thickbox_image_tag("/path/of/your/image-thumb.png", "/path/of/your/image.png", {:class=>"images"}, :title => "This is a test!") %>

You can add, title, controller, action, etc. because it is based on image_tag and link_to.
